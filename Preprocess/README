This folder contains code for preprocessing raw remote sensing tree cover product using Euler Cluster. 
The tree cover data were downloaded from "https://glad.umd.edu/users/Potapov/GLCLUC2020/Forest_extent_2000/" and "https://glad.umd.edu/users/Potapov/GLCLUC2020/Forest_extent_2020/".
The code compute fragmentation metrics within 5km resolution grid cells (the resolution can be adjusted).
