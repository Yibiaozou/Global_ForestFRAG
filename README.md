# Global_ForestFRAG

This repository contains code for the paper of fragmentation trends across global forest during the years 2000-2020.

1. "Preprocess" contains code for preprocessing raw remote sensing tree cover product using Euler Cluster of ETH Zurich. 
The tree cover data were downloaded from "https://glad.umd.edu/users/Potapov/GLCLUC2020/Forest_extent_2000/" and "https://glad.umd.edu/users/Potapov/GLCLUC2020/Forest_extent_2020/".
The code compute fragmentation metrics within 5km resolution grid cells (the resolution can be adjusted).

2. "Analysis_and_Figures" contains code for all of the main analysis and figures making.
   
3. "Data" contains some of the key data used in the study. It is impossible to include all of the source data in the repository, which is too large (more than 800 GB).
